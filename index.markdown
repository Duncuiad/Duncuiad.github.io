<h1>
Where's the coffee though?

Welcome to my little blog, where we blend some **maths** with some **programming**. My intent is to explore a handful of ideas, which at some point caught my attention, only to thereafter refuse to let that attention settle back down on other, often more urgent, matters.

Most of the ideas are best applied to **game development**, the industry I work in, but you may find that some of them adapt just as well to different disciplines.
