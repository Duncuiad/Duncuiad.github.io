My name is Federico, I'm a Junior Engine Programmer at Ubisoft Milan. I worked on *Mario + Rabbids: Sparks of Hope* ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_+_Rabbids_Sparks_of_Hope)) as Junior Gameplay Programmer.

Before working in game dev I studied maths. Having a preference for geometry over algebra, analysis or statistics, I already knew what my best shot at doing interesting maths every day would be. What better place than an industry that is built on geometry from the ground up? At least that was the idea, from the perspective of an outsider with little programming experience, based on some vague sense of what makes a game. But I'm happy to say that I was *mostly* right, on the geometry part at least, and now maths is the air I breathe with abandon in my daily work.

What I couldn't expect was finding a place where I'd be surrounded by people I deeply respect, for their work and their person. Some of them are mentors who led my growth and little by little lent me their trust, leaving me the space to show them how some more maths could make our work better. I can't show you most of those things, because I don't own them, but I can show you something else that I made all by myself. And that's what this website is about.

I hope my posts can catch your interest and maybe show you something you didn't know existed.
